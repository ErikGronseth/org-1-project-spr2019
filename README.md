# CSE 360 Project

This is the ToDo List Unlimited CSE 360 Project

## Github Setup

Hello teammates, I have setup this repo to disable pushing to master. This is to prevent someone from accidentally killing the entire project. I have also setup a review system to merge things into master, this is so that at least two people have read the code and signed off on it to minimize mistakes. If you have trouble with these systems, please message me and I will be happy to help.

### Feature Branches

How this will work is as follows,

You want to add/remove/change something in the repo, follow the following steps.

 1) Make a new branch in GitHub by clicking the branch dropdown, and selecting which branch you want to edit.
 2) Name the new branch and select create new branch. Please name it appropriately.
 3) Pulling the new branch in Eclipse. To do this, just right click the project in Eclipse and go to `Teams>Pull`
 4) Switch to the branch. Right click project, then `Team>Switch To>` then select the branch that you made
 5) Do Work
 6) Commit work
 7) Push Work
 8) Message someone to get a review done
 9) After review, if there are changes that need to be made, go to step 5)
 10) Merge branch
 11) Delete branch, you can do this by going the merged pull request and deleting the branch there
        1) This is to prevent using a branch after it has been merged, which can be hard to deal with.

Yes, this is a lot of steps, but this will prevent mistakes.
