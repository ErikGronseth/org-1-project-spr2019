# CSE 360 Project

This is the ToDo List Unlimited CSE 360 Project

## Github Setup

Hello teammates, I have setup this repo to disable pushing to master. This is to prevent someone from accidentally killing the entire project. I have also setup a review system to merge things into master, this is so that at least two people have read the code and signed off on it to minimize mistakes. If you have trouble with these systems, please message me and I will be happy to help.
